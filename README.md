## Introduction
In this project, we use the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022 dataset to predict developer salaries based on various features such as experience, location, education, etc. The Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model is employed for this task due to its robustness and accuracy in regression problems.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022 dataset, which contains information about developers' demographics, education, experience, and salaries. The dataset can be downloaded from the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey website](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).

## Libraries and Tools
The following libraries and tools are used in this project:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Train-test split

## Model Training
The Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model is trained on the preprocessed dataset. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model's performance. The key steps involved in model training are:
1. Importing the necessary libraries and dataset
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
4. Training the GBR model
5. Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score. The evaluation includes:
- Calculating the performance metrics on the test set
- Visualizing the actual vs predicted salaries
- Analyzing feature importance

## Results
The results of the model are analyzed and visualized to understand its performance and the importance of different features in predicting developer salaries. Key findings and visualizations include:
- The performance metrics of the model
- Feature importance plot
- Actual vs predicted salary plot
